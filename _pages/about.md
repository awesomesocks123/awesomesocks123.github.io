# **Sopheak** Chim

An aspiring engineer & developer with a experience in scripting, automation, and diagnostics and foundation in algorithms, data structures, and software development. I recently graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from California State University, Long Beach. My technical journey spans from hands-on automation to developing full-stack applications.

## What I Do

I'm passionate about creating software that solves real-world problems. My experience includes:

- Developing automation scripts for streamlining diagnostics and testing processes
- Building web applications with React, Node.js, and MongoDB
- Integrating API calls to external services for data retrieval and processing
- Designing intuitive user interfaces with modern frameworks like TailwindCSS
- LLM integration for generating content
- Fine-tuning models with datasets from Hugging Face
- Implementing machine learning models for data analysis and prediction

## My Approach

I believe in combining technical excellence with user-centered design. Whether I'm troubleshooting hardware/software edge cases or building a responsive web application.

Feel free to explore my [projects](/projects/), check out my [GitHub repositories](https://github.com/awesomesocks123), or take a look at my [CV](/cv/) for more details about my background and experience.

## Current Focus

I'm currently seeking SWE/SDE roles that combine hands-on technical skills with a strong focus on design, user experience, and test-driven development. I'm particularly interested in opportunities where I can leverage my experience with the building web-applications, automation, and working in Linux environments.
