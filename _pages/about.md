# **Sopheak** Chim

An aspiring engineer & developer with a strong foundation in scripting, automation, and diagnostics. I recently graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from California State University, Long Beach. My technical journey spans from hands-on automation at Silvus Technologies to developing full-stack applications.

## What I Do

I'm passionate about creating software that solves real-world problems. My experience includes:

- Developing automation scripts for streamlining diagnostics and testing processes
- Building web applications with React, Node.js, and MongoDB
- Integrating API calls to external services for data retrieval and processing
- Designing intuitive user interfaces with modern frameworks like TailwindCSS

## My Approach

I believe in combining technical excellence with user-centered design. Whether I'm troubleshooting hardware/software edge cases or building a responsive web application, I focus on creating solutions that are both technically sound and enjoyable to use.

Feel free to explore my [projects](/projects/), check out my [GitHub repositories](https://github.com/awesomesocks123), or take a look at my [CV](/cv/) for more details about my background and experience.

## Current Focus

I'm currently seeking SWE/SDE roles that combine hands-on technical skills with a strong focus on design, user experience, and test-driven development. I'm particularly interested in opportunities where I can leverage my experience with the MERN stack, automation, and Linux environments.
