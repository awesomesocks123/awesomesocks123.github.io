# Interview Mocker

[View on GitHub](https://github.com/awesomesocks123/testmocks)

## Project Overview

Interview Mocker is an AI-powered technical interview practice tool that combines a Python backend with an Electron frontend. It allows users to practice technical interviews using real LeetCode problems, receive AI-generated feedback, and improve their interviewing skills through realistic simulations.

## Key Features

- **Clipboard Integration** Paste from clipboard to and paste into AI responses to enhance context
- **Audio Recording**: Record verbal responses to interview questions
- **AI Feedback**: Receive intelligent feedback from a simulated interviewer
- **Response Replay**: Review previous AI responses for better learning

## System Architecture



## Technology Stack

### Backend (Python)
- **Flask**: API server framework
- **Flask-CORS**: Cross-origin resource sharing
- **OpenAI**: AI model integration
- **Whisper**: Speech-to-text transcription
- **SoundDevice**: Audio recording
- **Pyperclip**: Clipboard interaction

### Frontend (Electron) *Coming Soon*
- **Electron**: Cross-platform desktop application framework
- **React**
- **Node.js**

## Development Process

The Interview Mocker project was developed with a focus on creating a realistic technical interview experience. The application uses AI to simulate the role of an interviewer, providing contextual questions and feedback based on real LeetCode problems.

The system architecture was designed to be modular, allowing for easy extension and maintenance. The separation of the frontend and backend components enables independent development and testing, while the integration layer ensures seamless communication between all parts of the system.

This project demonstrates the power of combining modern web technologies with AI to create practical tools for developers to improve their technical interviewing skills.

## User Workflow

1. **Start the Application**: Launch the application using the provided start script
2. **Select a Problem**: Enter a LeetCode problem URL to establish the interview context
3. **Engage with the AI Interviewer**: Listen to the AI's introduction of the problem
4. **Respond to Questions**: Record verbal responses to the interviewer's questions
5. **Add Code Solutions**: Paste code from clipboard to enhance the interview context
6. **Review Feedback**: Receive detailed feedback on your approach and solution
7. **Practice Iteratively**: Try different problems or approaches to improve skills

## Future Directions

The Interview Mocker's architecture is designed with extensibility in mind, making it adaptable for various applications beyond technical interviews. The core system flow (user input → TTS → LLM API → text → ASR → user playback) can be leveraged for numerous use cases:

### Expanded Applications

- **Resume Review Simulation**: Mock interviews with personalized feedback on resume content
- **Meeting Preparation**: Practice important client or stakeholder meetings
- **Speech Rehearsal**: Prepare and refine presentations or public speaking engagements
- **Self-Quizzing**: Generate and answer questions on any topic for learning reinforcement
- **Language Practice**: Conversational practice for language learners with real-time feedback

The simplicity of setup combined with the power of modern AI makes this system highly adaptable, with potential applications extending far beyond its current implementation.

### Technical Architecture & Scaling

The current implementation is a simple Python program that handles text playback and recording in the terminal, but the architecture is designed for significant scaling:

- **API-First Design**: Nearly all components (except the LLM) are running locally for self-hosting potential
- **Self-Hosting Potential**: As LLM technology improves with quantization and distillation techniques that preserve core intelligence, the entire system could be self-hosted
- **Model Customization**: The system supports fine-tuned models, RAG implementations, and specialized reasoning models
- **Prompt Engineering**: The current implementation can be enhanced with more sophisticated prompting strategies

This simple yet powerful approach represents an optimal pattern for LLM integration and could serve as a building block for future AI-powered operating systems and applications. The modular design ensures that as individual components improve (speech recognition, text-to-speech, language models), the entire system benefits.

## Conclusion

The Interview Mocker project demonstrates how relatively simple components can be combined to create a powerful AI-assisted learning tool. By leveraging modern AI capabilities for speech recognition, natural language processing, and text-to-speech conversion, the application provides a valuable resource for technical interview preparation.

As AI technologies continue to evolve and become more accessible, this project's architecture provides a flexible foundation that can adapt to incorporate new capabilities and address additional use cases beyond technical interviews.
