## Project Overview

Chamo v2 is a redesigned version of my original 2024 capstone project. This revamp focuses on enhancing user experience by streamlining features and implementing a more modern, intuitive UI. The application enables real-time communication through both private messaging and public chat rooms, with comprehensive social features.
