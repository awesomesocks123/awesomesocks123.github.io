# 🛡️ Threat Modeling & Risk Analysis: Long Beach Ice Dogs Data Center

## 📘 Project Overview

**Date**: January 2022 – May 2022  
**Project Type**: Capstone-style Threat Modeling & Security Assessment  
**Target System**: 2023 Long Beach Ice Dogs Facility (Fictional Data Center)

This project involved conducting a comprehensive **threat modeling and risk mitigation analysis** for a fictional yet realistically designed data center. The project was designed to simulate the duties of a security analyst, focusing on identifying potential security threats and mapping them to controls from well-established cybersecurity frameworks.

---

## 🧠 Methodology

### 🧱 Frameworks & Standards Used

The project integrated multiple leading cybersecurity models and frameworks:
- **STRIDE Threat Model** – for categorizing and reasoning about threat types
- **MITRE ATT&CK Framework** – to align threats with adversary behavior patterns
- **CIS Critical Security Controls (v8)** – for identifying and validating control gaps
- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework** – to guide risk assessment and control selection

---

## 🔍 Scope & Execution

- **Identified 100 unique security threats** to assets within the Long Beach Ice Dogs facility
- **Developed 100 corresponding mitigations**, either technical or administrative
- **Assessed each threat** for:
  - **Likelihood** of exploitation (Low, Medium, High)
  - **Impact** on the system or organization
  - **Residual Risk** after applying mitigation

---

## 🔒 Control Categorization

Controls were classified into:
- **Technical Controls** – e.g., firewalls, logging systems, access management
- **Administrative Controls** – e.g., policies, user training, audit procedures

Each mitigation was reviewed for effectiveness and mapped to violated **CIS Controls** and relevant **NIST functions** (Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover).

        <td>Insider disables firewall</td>
        <td>Denial of Service</td>
        <td>Network Firewall</td>
        <td>Medium</td>
        <td>High</td>
        <td>Medium</td>
        <td>Administrative</td>
        <td>CIS 4.3, 5.1</td>

## 🧰 Tools & References

- Microsoft Excel (Threat Matrix)
- CIS Controls v8 documentation
- NIST CSF & SP 800-53
- MITRE ATT&CK Navigator
- OWASP Top 10 for application-level threat references

---

## 💼 Project Outcomes

- Demonstrated ability to conduct **structured threat modeling**
- Practiced **risk prioritization** and remediation planning
- Strengthened understanding of **industry cybersecurity standards**
- Learned how to align real-world threats with existing **security control frameworks**
- Produced a clear, actionable, and professional-grade **risk findings document**

## 🧾 Summary

> Using a blend of STRIDE, MITRE ATT&CK, CIS Controls, and NIST guidance, I identified 100 realistic cybersecurity threats and proposed practical, standards-aligned mitigations. This project not only developed my analytical and documentation skills but also simulated the risk evaluation responsibilities of a security analyst in a corporate or government IT environment.
